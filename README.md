## 🧠 Abstract

This work explores the detection and mitigation of **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks** in **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** environments using **deep learning techniques**, specifically a **VGG16-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture.

The research targets the SDN controller—a centralized yet vulnerable component in SDN architectures—and proposes a deep-learning-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that transforms traffic flows into RGB image representations to leverage the power of CNNs for real-time classification.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Dataset**: CICDDoS2019  
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Feature pruning, data cleaning, and class balancing
  - CSV-to-image transformation with 58×58 RGB matrix encoding
- **Model**:
  - Pretrained **VGG16 CNN** via transfer learning (ImageNet)
  - Tuned for SYN and UDP DDoS attacks
- **Evaluation Environment**:
  - SDN simulation using **Mininet** and **Ryu Controller**
  - Flow control via OpenFlow protocol actions (e.g., `OFPT_FLOW_MOD`)

## 📊 Results

- VGG16-based IDS demonstrated superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score compared to baseline CNN and classical ML models (ID3, RF, Naïve Bayes)
- Real-time controller-based mitigation is achieved through automated flow rule updates
- Effective against high-volume and low-rate DDoS attack variants
